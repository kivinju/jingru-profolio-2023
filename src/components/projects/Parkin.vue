            <h2><span>About This Project</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Project type:</strong> Individual project</p>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Two Months</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> This was my first project inspired by one of my best friends,
                a driver with a poor sense of direction.</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> It is difficult for drivers to find suitable parking spaces and remember their
                cars’ locations in a huge parking lot if it is full of cars.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>  A mobile application, by presenting the available parking spots and
                parking information, helps drivers find their suitable spots before they even show up in the parking lot.
                It also helps drivers to locate their cars quickly.</p>

                    steps. Some of the flows I explored included: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Search parking lot and navigate to it</li>
                    <li>Choose a parking space</li>

                <p>I created a prototype that could communicate the service as it would be as if it was running like a
                    real application. I chose a potential user, the person who inspired me, to walk through all the steps.</p>
                <p>By observing her complete these tasks I was able to uncover things that were confusing, unclear,
                    or needed to be changed.</p>

                <img src="../../assets/parkin/usability_test.png">
                <p>During the test, I found the app could be improved in some ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adjust the font size</li>
                    <li>Simplify the procedure</li>
                    <li>Ease navigation back to the main page</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As the tests validated or disproved many initial hypotheses, I continued to iterate on the designs.
                    By the end of this process, the app had changed drastically. Through each iteration I honed my visual
                    design skills and learned a lot about information architecture, hierarchy, and typography.</p>
